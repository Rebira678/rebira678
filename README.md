## 🚀 Long-Term Vision

I believe technology should empower people and simplify complexity. My ambition is to build a global technology company that delivers impactful, scalable solutions—whether through engineering leadership, product development, or creating platforms that help others build.

I'm interested in:
*   **Scalable System Design:** Building platforms that handle millions of users with reliability and performance.
*   **Founder-Led Engineering:** Bridging the gap between technical execution and business vision.
*   **Mentorship & Leadership:** Elevating teams through technical guidance, culture, and shared ownership.
